# Cinema Dashboard

A Streamlit dashboard that merges Letterboxd watchlist data with French cinema showtimes.

## Overview

Cinema Dashboard is the orchestration layer for a three-project pipeline:

| Project | Role |
|---------|------|
| `movies_management` | Fetches and caches Letterboxd ratings + watchlist as parquet files |
| `Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping` | Scrapes French cinema showtimes to `showtimes.parquet` |
| `cinema_dashboard` *(this repo)* | Reads both parquets and visualises the combined data |

The dashboard is mostly read-only — it reads parquet files written by the other two projects. The one exception is the Recommendations page, which can append new theaters to the theaters CSV (`ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH`) when the user confirms adding one via the chat.

## Pages

### Home (🏠)

Lead-with-the-answer overview hub: a hero card for tonight's next watchlist screening, horizontal poster rails (up next, "because you like {top director}", discover by genre), and a small KPI strip at the bottom. Uses the cinema theme + Inter/Playfair editorial typography. Renders a designed empty state with CTA when no upcoming watchlist screenings exist.

**Requires**: `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH` + `ALLOCINE_OUTPUT_PATH`

### Showtimes (🎟️)

Top chip-filter bar (theaters, genres, runtime buckets `<90` / `90–120` / `>120`, weekend toggle, free-text search) over three tabs:
- **By day** — horizontal poster rails grouped by date, with posters resolved via a left-join to the watchlist
- **Map** — pydeck map of theaters with marker size ∝ today's showtime count
- **Table** — raw dataframe with poster + Letterboxd link columns

**Requires**: `ALLOCINE_OUTPUT_PATH` (+ `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH` for posters, `ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH` for the map)

### Movies Database (📊)

Three calmer tabs in place of the old chart wall:
- **Overview** — Genre × avg rating chart (rated films only) + micro-card insights (runtime distribution sparkline, top directors chip cloud, top themes chip cloud). A caption below the title clarifies the stats are based on your rated films count.
- **Discover** — chip filters (genre, director multiselect with live search, min-rating slider) over a poster rail of matching films
- **Tables** — raw dataframes with poster, IMDB, TMDB, and Letterboxd link columns

**Requires**: `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH`

### Watchlist Calendar (📅)

Inner-joins your watchlist with current showtimes. Top chip-filter bar (theaters, genres, runtime buckets, weekend toggle, free-text search) + sidebar date range over three tabs:
- **By day** — horizontal poster rails grouped by date; one card per movie with all showtimes for that day listed below (time + theater), sorted by earliest showtime
- **Calendar** — ICS and CSV export for your filtered screenings (Google / Apple / Outlook compatible)
- **Map** — pydeck map of theaters with screenings in the current filter; marker size ∝ # screenings

**Requires**: `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH` + `ALLOCINE_OUTPUT_PATH` (+ `ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH` for the map)

### Recommendations (🤖)

Chat interface powered by the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api) (model configurable via `HF_MODEL`, defaults to `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`). Ask questions like:

- "Which watchlist movies are showing this weekend?"
- "Based on my taste, what should I prioritise?"
- "What's showing at Cinéma X that I'd enjoy?"

Power-user surface: prompt-suggestion chips, streaming spinner with transparent tool-call expanders, in-page pinned-recommendations column on the right (substring-match watchlist titles in each reply, then click to pin), Markdown conversation export.

The same assistant is reachable from any page via the global **`Cmd+K`** command palette (or the "✦ Ask AI" sidebar button). Both surfaces share `st.session_state['rec_messages']` so the conversation persists across them.

The page derives a taste profile from your Letterboxd ratings (top genres and directors by average rating) and sends only the matched watchlist-showtime rows to the model — no full parquets are transmitted.

#### Auto-adding theaters

If you mention a theater that isn't already tracked, the model automatically searches Allocine for matching Paris cinemas (via tool use). You'll see "Add" buttons for each match — clicking one appends the theater to your theaters CSV (`ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH`) as `theater_id,theater_name,address`. Re-run the Allocine scraper afterwards to fetch its showtimes.

The page also backfills missing addresses for existing CSV entries on first load, using the Allocine API cache.

**Requires**: `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH` + `ALLOCINE_OUTPUT_PATH` + `ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH` + `HF_API_KEY`

```

All pages share `utils/data_loader.py` for parquet I/O and the watchlist↔showtimes join. Centralising the loaders means Streamlit's `@st.cache_data` keys on a single qualified function name, so each parquet is read once across all pages within the cache TTL — navigating between pages is a cache hit.

All pages are read-only with respect to parquet data. The only file the dashboard ever **writes** is the theaters CSV (`ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH`), and only when the user explicitly confirms adding a theater via the Recommendations chat.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- The two companion repos cloned as siblings: `../movies_management/` and `../Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping/`

### Installation

Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
make install
```

Alternatively with pip:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install -e ../movies_management
pip install -e ../Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping
```

`make install` installs dependencies from `pyproject.toml` for this project and both companion projects.

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the paths:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH` | Directory containing the three `*_letterboxd.parquet` files from `movies_management` |
| `ALLOCINE_OUTPUT_PATH` | Path to `showtimes.parquet` written by `Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping` |
| `ALLOCINE_INPUT_PATH` | Path to the theaters CSV read by `Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping` — also written to when adding a theater via the Recommendations chat |
| `HF_API_KEY` | Hugging Face API token (free) — required for the Recommendations page. Create one at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) |
| `LETTERBOXD_USERNAME` | Your Letterboxd username — required for the orchestrator and Dagster pipeline |
| `LETTERBOXD_DAYS_TO_UPDATE` | Days before cached movie metadata is considered stale and refreshed (default: 365) |
| `HF_MODEL` | Hugging Face model ID for the Recommendations page (default: `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`) |
| `HF_MAX_TOKENS` | Max tokens for model responses (default: 1024) |
| `ALLOCINE_DIR` | *(optional)* Absolute path to the `Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping` repo. Defaults to `../Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping` relative to this repo. |
| `MOVIES_DIR` | *(optional)* Absolute path to the `movies_management` repo. Defaults to `../movies_management` relative to this repo. |

### Running

```bash
streamlit run app.py
# or
make run
```

## Data refresh

### Option 1 — CLI (lightweight)

Use `orchestrate.py` to refresh all data in one command. It runs both scrapers in parallel and only re-runs a scraper if its data is stale:

```bash
python orchestrate.py            # refresh stale data only
python orchestrate.py --force    # always re-run both scrapers
python orchestrate.py --days 7   # scrape 7 days of showtimes instead of 14
python orchestrate.py --reset    # pass --reset to Allocine scraper (clears tmp cache)
python orchestrate.py --reset-db # pass --reset_database to movies_management
```

**Staleness rules:**
- `showtimes.parquet` — stale if last written before the most recent Tuesday (French cinemas publish the new week's programme on Tuesdays)
- `watchlist_with_letterboxd.parquet` — stale if older than 7 days

After the Allocine scrape succeeds, the orchestrator automatically runs a third step that expands `data_letterboxd.parquet` with Letterboxd metadata for every film found in the fresh `showtimes.parquet` — not only the user's watchlist and ratings. Films that cannot be resolved to a Letterboxd slug are written to `{MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH}/unresolved_allocine.parquet`.

Output is timestamped and labelled per scraper:
```
2026-05-04 13:00:00 [INFO] [allocine] Fetching Le Champo...
2026-05-04 13:00:01 [INFO] [letterboxd] Fetching watchlist for adjm...
2026-05-04 13:01:30 [INFO] [allocine] Done.
2026-05-04 13:01:31 [INFO] [enrich] Enriching Letterboxd cache from showtimes...
2026-05-04 13:03:00 [INFO] [enrich] Done.
```

### Option 2 — Dagster UI

The `pipeline/` folder contains a Dagster pipeline with the same two scrapers as software-defined assets, manual jobs, and automatic cron-based materialisation.

```bash
pip install dagster dagster-webserver   # first time only
dagster dev -m pipeline.definitions    # opens UI at localhost:3000
```

Three jobs are available in the UI:
- `showtimes_job` — runs the Allocine scraper
- `watchlist_job` — runs the Letterboxd scraper
- `all_scrapers_job` — runs all three assets (showtimes, cache enrichment, watchlist)

Assets are also configured with `AutomationCondition` for automatic scheduling (showtimes: Tuesday 06:00, watchlist: Monday 06:00) when the Dagster daemon is running. The `letterboxd_cache_enriched` asset has `deps=["showtimes"]` and runs automatically after each showtimes materialisation.

You can also run each scraper manually:
```bash
cd ../movies_management && python main.py
cd ../Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping && python main.py
```

Streamlit cache TTL is **5 minutes**, shared across all pages (`DATA_TTL_SECONDS` in [`utils/data_loader.py`](utils/data_loader.py)). Conversation history on the Recommendations page is session-scoped and not affected by the cache.

## Troubleshooting

**"MOVIES_OUTPUT_PATH is not set"** — add it to `cinema_dashboard/.env`.

**"Watchlist data not found"** — run `python main.py` in `movies_management`.

**"Showtimes data not found"** — run `python main.py` in `Allocine-Showtimes-Scraping`.

**"No upcoming showtimes for your watchlist"** — either your watchlist is empty, no watchlist movies are currently showing, or the showtimes data is stale (re-run the scraper).

**`streamlit-calendar` not available** — the calendar page falls back to a table view. Install the package with `pip install streamlit-calendar`.

**Map shows no theaters** — addresses are geocoded once via Nominatim (rate-limited, free) and cached to `data/theaters_geo.parquet`. To force re-geocoding, delete the parquet. Theaters whose addresses Nominatim can't resolve are kept in tables but skipped on the map.

**`Cmd+K` doesn't open the assistant** — the keyboard shortcut depends on `streamlit-shortcuts`; if it's missing or the binding fails on your browser, the "✦ Ask AI" button in the sidebar opens the same dialog.

**Theme looks broken / fonts not loading** — `assets/styles.css` imports Inter and Playfair Display from Google Fonts. Browsers without internet access render the dashboard with system fallbacks; the layout still works.

**"HF_API_KEY is not set"** — add your Hugging Face token to `cinema_dashboard/.env`.

**"No upcoming showtimes for your watchlist"** (Recommendations page) — either no watchlist movies are currently showing, or the showtimes data is stale. Re-run both scrapers to refresh.

## Known limitations

- Only covers Allocine (French cinemas). Other regions require a different showtimes source.
- Watchlist-to-showtimes matching joins on the normalised TMDB French title (`french_title`) vs Allocine's French display title, confirmed by director overlap. Films whose French title differs significantly between the two sources may not be matched.
- Data is only as fresh as the last scraper run.
